      "You are too selfish to ever be a good person.\n",

      "That is a brand of toothpaste.\n",
      "Look, the only thing that you are concerned with is your own happiness.\n",

      "Here's the perfect test.\n",
      "There's something fun that you want to do, and then there's something less fun that people are doing for the common good.\n",
      "Which do you choose?\n",
      "Well, that is a really tough question.\n",
      "Most great philosophers would say helping you is pointless, that you can't try to be good, especially when your motivations are so obviously corrupt.\n",
      "On the other hand, Aristotle thought that moral virtue is something that you could get better at.\n",
      "He� he compared it to playing the flute.\n",

      "Well, it looks like you cleaned up everything.\n",
      "You're doing this because you feel bad.\n",
      "And you're not even doing it to get me to help you anymore, because I told you that's not gonna happen.\n",
      "Well, feeling remorse about being wrong isn't as good as just doing something right, but it's a start.\n",
      "Look, I think you're capable of change.\n",

      "Yeah.\n",
      "That, that's what everyone wants everyone to do.\n",

      "No, she didn't!\n",

      "So what do we do here?\n",
      "I can't believe I'm doing this, but, Jason, please come to my classroom.\n",
      "I will teach you ethics, like I'm doing with Eleanor.\n",
      "And if you work hard and absorb the material, you just might be able to earn your place here.\n",
      "Do you have to call me a nerd so much?\n",
      "Wow.\n",
      "Uh, that's really impressive.\n",
      "Uh, where's Jianyu?\n",
      "Wow!\n",
      "That's great, man!\n",
      "Um, I mean� it's ethics but that's great.\n",

      "So, to sum up, Utilitarianism posits that the correct choice is the one that causes the most good or pleasure, and the least pain and suffering.\n",
      "Ah, but here's the problem.\n",
      "If all that matters is the sum total of \"goodness\", then you can justify any number of bad actions, like torturing one innocent person to save a hundred, or preemptive war�\n",
      "Um� okay, what?\n",
      "Shockingly, that is a relevant example of the Utilitarian dilemma.\n",
      "Well done.\n",

      "You mind turning that off?\n",

      "I never had a soul mate on Earth.\n",
      "I never even really had a girlfriend that I loved.\n",
      "And when I got here, and Michael said I would finally meet my actual soul mate, I was so excited.\n",
      "And it isn't� exactly what I thought.\n",
      "Mornin'.\n",
      "What's this about?\n",
      "I've never actually done this before.\n",
      "This is a theoretical fantasy.\n",

      "No.\n",
      "Quick summary of contractualism.\n",
      "Uh, imagine a group of reasonable people are coming up with the rules for a new society.\n",
      "Sure, but anyone can veto any rule that they think is unfair.\n",
      "So, if you said, \"We should be able to break our promises without any repercussions\", someone would veto that rule.\n",
      "Well, that's called \"tyranny\".\n",
      "And it's generally frowned upon.\n",
      "If you make a promise to someone, you should do it.\n",
      "Just like I promised to help you and still am, despite your constant mockery.\n",
      "That's literally not possible.\n",
      "No way.\n",
      "No, that's really weird.\n",
      "You can't make small talk with her for one day without being caught?\n",
      "Well, if I feel sympathy for anyone, it's Tahani.\n",
      "She's going through the same thing I am, but she doesn't know it.\n",
      "Which means maybe I'm obligated to tell her.\n",
      "Although, maybe it's better not to know.\n",
      "Is ignorance bliss, or will the painful truth actually be healing�\n",
      "Hey!\n",
      "Maybe I'll come too.\n",
      "I know.\n",
      "But Eleanor's off with Michael, and Jianyu feels comfortable when I'm around.\n",
      "Right?\n",
      "Yes, you were.\n",
      "You were made in Taiwan.\n",
      "So� couples date!\n",

      "And, also, I will be joining them.\n",
      "Oh, no, no, it's just me.\n",
      "Yup, and, uh, there is a pair of people, Tahani and Jianyu.\n",
      "And then also I am here.\n",
      "No one.\n",
      "Um, it's really quite simple, Janet.\n",
      "They are a couple, and I am a third part of that couple, a helper part who is here for fun and excitement.\n",
      "It's a three-person couple.\n",
      "Okay, you have to step up.\n",
      "Find a way to connect with her without, you know, being you.\n",
      "That's the opposite of being nice?\n",
      "Or what if� while Janet massages Tahani, I massage Jianyu?\n",
      "Sorry, just working the oft-neglected mandible area.\n",
      "Dude, she's trying so hard, and you're giving her nothing!\n",
      "Just pick a fact that you know about her and just muddle through.\n",
      "She said she likes impressionist paintings.\n",
      "No, no, no, I definitely feel like I need to say more.\n",
      "Jianyu�\n",
      "You sure this is where you want to be right now?\n",
      "At the Tea for Two couples cafe?\n",
      "I love Degas.\n",
      "I took painting lessons as a kid, and Degas was always my inspiration.\n",
      "Well, they enslaved my country for 300 years.\n",
      "So, no.\n",
      "But they have great museums.\n",
      "Oh, well, we're not soulmates.\n",
      "We're just� soul friends.\n",
      "What?\n",
      "What's going on?\n",
      "Oh, I'm so sorry.\n",
      "Michael, you can't be the problem.\n",
      "What did you say to him?\n",
      "Did you make him do this somehow?\n",
      "No, it's terrible.\n",
      "Michael's wrong.\n",
      "He's not the problem.\n",
      "It doesn't change the fact that we weren't truthful.\n",
      "There's an old Chinese proverb� \"Lies are like tigers.\n",
      "They are bad.\"\n",
      "It's more poetic in Mandarin.\n",

      "Oh, thanks, Henry.\n",
      "Whoa!\n",
      "New boots.\n",
      "Oh� oh, yeah.\n",
      "No.\n",

      "Bye.\n",
      "My God� what have I done?\n",
      "What is \"retirement\" for you exactly?\n",
      "What?\n",
      "Okay, you have two options.\n",
      "You can confess and save Michael, or you can continue to lie and condemn him to an eternity of unimaginable pain.\n",
      "No, there's no way to stop this except confessing.\n",
      "Any moment now, Michael is going to get on that train, and we will never see him again, just like Professor Lindeman after I asked him to reread my 3,600-page manuscript.\n",
      "He said he was going out for cigarettes, but then he just left his tenured position at the Sorbonne.\n",
      "Whoa.\n",
      "You want to kill Janet?\n",
      "You cannot kill Janet.\n",
      "Killing is one of the most famous moral no-nos.\n",
      "Do you know who said that?\n",
      "It was Machiavelli� a very non-Oprah-like figure.\n",
      "And what happens after we kill her?\n",
      "We'll have to lie to everyone about what we did, and lying is always wrong.\n",
      "Why?\n",
      "Why would I tell Henry that I liked his boots?\n",
      "I don't like his boots.\n",
      "I hate his boots.\n",
      "I lied to him.\n",
      "You wrote your thesis on Kant.\n",
      "He believed that lying is always morally wrong� no exceptions.\n",
      "They do?\n",
      "Uh, I did, yeah.\n",
      "Great lecture, by the way� so bleak.\n",
      "Oh, my God.\n",
      "Wow.\n",
      "I can't accept these.\n",

      "I told you that I loved your boots three years ago, and I was lying, and that lie has haunted me ever since, and people tried to tell me it was fine� just a nice, little white lie in the form of social niceties� but I disagreed, and then yesterday I thought you were gonna die, but now you're not dead, and I can finally be honest and say that those boots are terrible and hideous and I hate them.\n",
      "Whoo!\n",
      "Yeah, I know.\n",
      "And I get it.\n",
      "I don't care that she came back or that we did it for a good reason.\n",
      "I can't live with this lie.\n",
      "I'm going to confess to the murder of Janet.\n",
      "We didn't?\n",
      "Hey, Janet?\n",
      "Janet, would you please recite the English alphabet?\n",
      "She literally knew everything in the universe, and now she's a baby.\n",
      "And even if she were okay, it would be too painful for me to live with these lies.\n",
      "Fine.\n",
      "I won't say anything because I promised to help you.\n",
      "And the moral implications� of everything that we've done are so complicated that I may never untangle them, but I hate lying.\n",
      "I always have, and this is going to eat me up inside forever.\n",
      "You might be able to shrug this off, and forget about it, but I never will.\n",
      "Oh, boy.\n",
      "Oh, boy.\n",
      "Tahani, please.\n",
      "I understand that Eleanor violated our trust, but please, when you're talking to Michael, try to think about what she's had to go through.\n",
      "Thank you for confessing, I don't know what I would have done if you hadn't --\n",
      "Oh�\n",
      "This is terrible.\n",
      "What am I supposed to do if he asks me?\n",
      "You just casually cited Immanuel Kant.\n",
      "Yeah, I know we're in a miserable bind here, but this might be the proudest day of my life.\n",
      "Sure, just like the AllSpark from Transformers, and he'll know instantly if you're lying about anything so only smiles and nods, got it?\n",
      "I agree.\n",
      "You didn't trick me.\n",
      "I repeatedly asked you to stop.\n",
      "Well, actually, she learned a great deal in a very short amount of time --\n",
      "Michael�\n",
      "Michael, I murdered Janet.\n",
      "I knew about Eleanor from the beginning.\n",
      "I've been trying to help her become a better person, and when she found out that your retirement meant that you would be tortured, she immediately tried to find a way to prevent it.\n",
      "Eleanor is learning.\n",
      "She's just doing it after she died.\n",
      "Well, maybe there should be.\n",
      "So, how did you not realize you had the wrong Eleanor?\n",
      "Wait, what was your house like?\n",
      "Famously a piano player.\n",
      "Oh, of course, so sorry.\n",
      "Let's get some dinner.\n",
      "Well, that looks delicious.\n",
      "What is that?\n",
      "Oh, that sounds so good.\n",
      "I mean, the soup, not the� human trafficking.\n",
      "Should we�\n",
      "Splitsies?\n",
      "That's awful.\n",
      "And for you to have gone through all that, and to end up where you did, it is just� it's just amazing.\n",
      "I assure you, our relationship was \"teacher-student\", nothing more.\n",
      "Um, yes, it's incredible.\n",
      "There's an amazing library, there's a beautiful, piranha-free lake.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Here, drink this.\n",
      "Well, The Bad Place Crew requested that the hangover filter be turned off.\n",
      "They like them.\n",
      "So, Michael said we're meeting at Tahani's place in an hour for a negotiation session.\n",
      "We'll walk over together?\n",
      "Yeah, Eleanor, just because we have a new guest in the house doesn't mean I'm not still gonna be there for you.\n",
      "I'm in this.\n",
      "We're a team.\n",
      "Who's Shawn?\n",
      "Should be fun.\n",
      "That's all I'm thinking about now.\n",
      "I'm sorry, choices are hard for me when I'm under pressure.\n",
      "Right, which is why I can't take this lightly.\n",
      "What if I screw up?\n",
      "Oh, boy, now I'm nervous about that decision.\n",
      "I don't know.\n",
      "Yeah, it would be easier to sort out the issue of dry erase versus paper if I could write down the pros and cons for each, but, of course, I would have to use one of them to write down the pros and cons for them, which is problematic.\n",
      "Gotta go spend that money you stole.\n",
      "Okay, thanks for this conversation.\n",
      "Oh, but --\n",
      "I need to step outside� for some air, and I will not be back for many days.\n",
      "I, uh� I know we're short on time, but I need your help with a personal dilemma.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Which person is my soul mate?\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "But, it's one of those two people.\n",
      "What?\n",
      "Okay, getting close here.\n",
      "Just mulling the ethical ramifications of various soups.\n",
      "Yeah, you know, maybe that's smart.\n",
      "How are you?\n",
      "Uzo, it's been too long.\n",
      "Sorry?\n",
      "Well, Uzo, this isn't choosing soccer teams on a playground.\n",
      "When something's important to me, I can make a decision.\n",
      "Watch.\n",
      "Uh, excuse me, excuse me.\n",
      "I have decided I would like to unequivocally order the pumpkin soup.\n",
      "Yeah, I don't know what I was thinking.\n",
      "Excuse me, risotto.\n",
      "Risotto?\n",
      "How do you know?\n",
      "Well, hang on, let me think about that.\n",
      "Because it --\n",
      "I had a little trouble writing my speech.\n",
      "Um, I wrote 11 different versions.\n",
      "Oh, boy, I mean, these run about 55 minutes a piece.\n",
      "I'm really hot!\n",
      "Is this air-conditioner even working?\n",
      "Okay, well, there's an issue there.\n",
      "Uh, involving what I consider to be unfair labor practices on the part of the jeweler.\n",
      "I'm sorry.\n",
      "You were right.\n",
      "This is too much for me.\n",
      "You should just leave me here and go get married.\n",
      "Oh, no.\n",
      "No, I mean, I'm relieved, but this is embarrassing.\n",
      "Look, I know I can be indecisive, but what's the harm in taking a few extra minutes to find the perfect --\n",
      "You're right.\n",
      "I just need to make decision.\n",
      "I'm gonna look each of these women in the eye, trust my gut, and figure out how I feel.\n",
      "Oh!\n",
      "Hey, it's my three favorite yogurts.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "What?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "What?\n",
      "What?\n",
      "Whoa, your point total was crazy high, Eleanor.\n",
      "You just lost five points.\n",
      "Yeah, I don't know what I love more about our morning hard-boiled egg routine, the eggs or the routine.\n",
      "\"I love you.\"\n",
      "How cute.\n",
      "I love you too, egg.\n",
      "Oh� well, that is something.\n",
      "Great.\n",
      "You wanna talk about eggs again?\n",
      "Hey, can I ask your advice on something?\n",
      "Well, it's a sensitive matter, and you� you do know me pretty well.\n",
      "So, here it is.\n",
      "Real Eleanor said she loves me.\n",
      "I don't know what to do.\n",
      "I mean, we are soulmates, so I probably do love her, but then again, how do I know if my motivation is correct?\n",
      "Maybe I think I'm supposed to love her, but if I tell her that I love her for the wrong reasons, it won't mean anything.\n",
      "You think?\n",
      "Hey, your score just went up 20 points.\n",
      "I'm� I'm sorry that I haven't been able to say� what you want me to say, because I do want to say it.\n",
      "Honestly, my biggest fear is just making sure that my motivation for saying it�\n",
      "Her motivation changed.\n",
      "She couldn't earn enough points by apologizing to everyone here because she was only doing it to earn enough points to stay here.\n",
      "But she did earn enough points, which means that she's decided not to stay here, which means --\n",
      "What's happening?\n",
      "What did he just say?\n",
      "Eleanor dedicated herself to the study of ethics.\n",
      "I was blown away by her capacity for self-improvement.\n",
      "What?\n",
      "Her memories?\n",
      "As in, all the things she's done on Earth?\n",
      "Yeah, Judge, request permission to speak somewhat emotionally?\n",
      "Okay, look, I know, obviously, these memories aren't great.\n",
      "I was particularly disturbed by \"Started Fire in Mailbox to Get Mailman to Take Off Shirt\", but that was the old Eleanor.\n",
      "She changed.\n",
      "She worked, and she studied, and she got better.\n",
      "And it wasn't just self-preservation, it was real self-improvement.\n",
      "I made the decision to help Eleanor that first week, and I'm glad I did.\n",
      "Because she's worth it.\n",
      "What?\n",
      "Uh, kind of like a last meal.\n",
      "That's what you think Hell is?\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "\"Ethically\".\n",
      "Great.\n",
      "The one time you actually remember something from class.\n",
      "I was trying to stop you from doing it!\n",
      "No way.\n",
      "Eleanor wouldn't do that.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "But no.\n",
      "Please don't make me think about this again.\n",
      "My brain will break.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Mmm, that checks out.\n",
      "I feel like I failed you.\n",
      "What?\n",
      "Eleanor, that's crazy.\n",
      "You belong here.\n",
      "Why would you go?\n",
      "Wait, no.\n",
      "You're not going.\n",
      "I am.\n",
      "Real Eleanor is my soulmate or was my soulmate and she's only going down there because she thinks that I don't love her.\n",
      "I don't know.\n",
      "Please don't ask me that.\n",
      "My stomach hurts.\n",
      "The point is, if she's going down there because of me, I'll never be at peace.\n",
      "What?\n",
      "What?\n",
      "Eleanor, what's going on?\n",
      "No, this doesn't make any sense.\n",

      "How can I be over it?\n",
      "We haven't discussed it or even spoken for days.\n",
      "Well, uh� there's something you don't know about me.\n",
      "I read an article saying that growing almonds was bad for the environment, and yet I continued to use almond milk in my coffee --\n",
      "Oh, fork!\n",
      "You're right.\n",
      "Every friend, every girlfriend was driven nuts because I couldn't do anything.\n",
      "I missed my mom's back surgery because I had already promised my landlord's nephew that I would help him figure out his new phone.\n",
      "I made everyone miserable.\n",
      "Uh, next time?\n",
      "I can't.\n",
      "I can't.\n",
      "Yes?\n",
      "What?\n",
      "There really is an afterlife.\n",
      "I can't wait to have breakfast with Kant, lunch with Michel Foucault, dinner with Kant again, so we can talk about what came up at breakfast --\n",
      "All of my heroes are --\n",
      "No way.\n",
      "Soulmates are real?\n",
      "Oh, no.\n",
      "I don't have one, do I?\n",
      "That's fine.\n",
      "Who needs a soulmate, anyway?\n",
      "My soulmate will be� books.\n",
      "So, how do you choose who I should be with?\n",
      "I� what?\n",
      "Cool beans.\n",
      "One second, guys.\n",
      "So, so -- yeah.\n",
      "So, making decisions isn't necessarily my strong suit.\n",
      "There were too many toppings and very early in the process, you had to commit to a chocolate palette or a fruit palette.\n",
      "If you couldn't decide, you wound up with kiwi, Junior Mint, raisin, and it ruins everyone's night.\n",
      "Great.\n",
      "Thanks, Denise.\n",
      "It's interesting that Hawaiian pizza's so popular here.\n",
      "So, I can't believe you studied in Brisbane.\n",
      "We must've just missed each other.\n",
      "What was your thesis on?\n",
      "And Immanuel Kant!\n",
      "No, but that pairing is the most obvious pairing to employ in a paper with that title, and I wanna read it so bad.\n",
      "What about Morocco?\n",
      "You ever travel there?\n",
      "What about anywhere else?\n",
      "You been anywhere else?\n",
      "Well, um, I mean, you're both brilliant, accomplished women, and Pedro, you're great, too.\n",
      "Just amazing people.\n",
      "I'm surrounded.\n",
      "But if I had to say who I, sort of, immediately bonded to on a gut level, I think I would say that I kind of feel like my soulmate is Angelique --\n",
      "No, we did not.\n",
      "No one said anything, I didn't hear anything, and I certainly didn't say anything.\n",
      "That's for darn sure.\n",

      "No, I wouldn't say that.\n",
      "Do you look bad?\n",
      "No.\n",
      "But good, would I go as far as to say is, you look good?\n",
      "Doubtful.\n",
      "Hey, wine.\n",
      "Mmm.\n",
      "Uh� do I feel like red or white?\n",

      "How about you?\n",
      "Oh, no.\n",
      "I'm so sorry, I� but I have to ask, do you feel the way I feel?\n",

      "You mean Janet.\n",
      "You already forgot her name.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Look, I'm sorry, but none of this means anything to me, and I've got my own problems to deal with.\n",
      "I'm sorry.\n",
      "I can't help you.\n",
      "Janet, could you show me to the bar, please?\n",

      "I'm sorry.\n",
      "I'm trying to process a tremendous amount of insane information.\n",
      "I mean, you're not supposed to be here.\n",

      "If we got all the way to Scanlon, we must have been studying very intensely for a long time.\n",

      "Yes.\n",
      "I was a professor of ethics and moral philosophy, focusing on deontology.\n",

      "Wait a few trillion years, the guilt will fade.\n",
      "Before I can teach Michael to be good, I have to force him to think about what we used to think about.\n",

      "Hi, Jeanette.\n",
      "No, no.\n",
      "This is worse.\n",
      "An existential crisis is an acknowledgement that life is absurd and that absurdity needs to be confronted.\n",
      "But this is just denial.\n",
      "And at any moment, that denial could collapse and he'll be a mess.\n",
      "He is a Jenga tower of sadness.\n",
      "It's not that easy.\n",

      "You are driving a trolley when the breaks fail.\n",
      "And on the track ahead of you are five workmen you will run over.\n",
      "Now, you can steer to another track, but on that track is one person you'd kill instead of the five.\n",
      "What do you do?\n",
      "You don't know any of the workers.\n",
      "Good!\n",
      "But there's many other versions.\n",
      "What if you knew one of the people?\n",

      "Let's say you're a doctor and you can save five patients.\n",
      "But you have to kill one healthy person and use his organs to do it.\n",
      "Why not?\n",
      "It's still choosing to kill one person to save five, isn't it?\n",

      "Would you please read your first paragraph?\n",
      "Do you see how you're already off-topic?\n",
      "Okay, sure, but philosophy is about questioning things you take for granted and I don't think you're doing that.\n",

      "� and this Chidi is an impostor.\n",
      "So, in a way, it doesn't matter if I was better in version 492 or whatever because the best version of me is just as much about my effect on the world around me, as it is about my own egocentric self-image.\n",

      "Now, first off, there's \"virtue ethics\".\n",
      "Aristotle believed that there were certain virtues of mind and character, like courage or generosity, and you should try to develop yourself in accordance with those virtues.\n",
      "Next, there's consequentialism.\n",
      "The basis for judgement about whether something is right or wrong stems from the consequences of that action.\n",
      "How much utility or good did it accomplish versus how much pain or bad.\n",
      "And finally, there's deontology.\n",
      "The school of thought that there are strict rules and duties that everyone must adhere to in a functioning society.\n",
      "Being ethical is simply identifying and obeying those duties and following those rules.\n",
      "But here's the thing, my little chili babies, all three of those theories are hot, stinky cat dookie.\n",
      "The true meaning of life, the actual ethical system that you should all follow is nihilism.\n",

      "I cannot lie to cover for you.\n",
      "Please, remember, you're supposed to be a monk.\n",
      "Hey.\n",
      "Eleanor and Michael are here.\n",
      "What a fun surprise.\n",
      "Uh, yes, my apartment was decorated in one way and now it has been� redecorated.\n",
      "I mean, you know how monks are.\n",
      "Calm.\n",
      "Peaceful.\n",
      "Never, you know� shotgunning Cheez Whiz.\n",
      "I mean, what monk would do that?\n",
      "No monk!\n",
      "Anyway� I see you guys are still here.\n",
      "Actually, I don't think I can make it.\n",
      "I just remembered� I can make it, so I will see you there.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Bye.\n",
      "No!\n",

      "Jianyu tossed my rock, uh, because he wanted to help me, his friend, who loves motorcycles and Canadian TV actress, Pamela Anderson.\n",

      "I� I can't.\n",
      "I spent my whole life on Earth battling a stomachache because I never knew what to do.\n",
      "And for a while here, that was gone, but recently, I've been miserable.\n",
      "I know, but I have this problem.\n",
      "And if I choose Option A� but if I choose option B� no.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "No.\n",
      "I'm� I'm used to moral dilemmas.\n",
      "I like moral dilemmas.\n",
      "They're my jam.\n",

      "Like I'm being punished somehow.\n",
      "And, obviously, I know that's silly.\n",
      "This is the Good Place.\n",
      "You two would never do anything to hurt anyone.\n",
      "But I am seriously worried that I did something wrong, and this is the universe getting back at me.\n",
      "Oh, no.\n",
      "Uh, wait, what's� what's happening now?\n",
      "Oh, no.\n",
      "No, no, no.\n",
      "I� I made God cry?\n",
      "Oh, stomachache.\n",
      "Welcome back, old friend.\n",
      "Why?\n",
      "Why are you crying?\n",
      "You did?\n",
      "Oh, good.\n",
      "What is it?\n",
      "Uh� the motorcycle.\n",
      "Yup, that's my problem.\n",
      "For some reason, it just hasn't been bringing me as much happiness as maybe it was intended to, so I'd just as soon get rid of it.\n",
      "Great.\n",
      "Uh, Eleanor, I hope you feel better.\n",
      "Hey, Jason?\n",
      "New plan.\n",
      "Instead of just trying not to get caught, we're going to study ethics.\n",

      "Hang on, just editing my syllabus in my head based on that comment.\n",
      "Thank you.\n",
      "That's an amazing compliment.\n",
      "And I'm sorry your actual motorcycle blew up.\n",
      "Oh!\n",
      "I'm a pretty decent artist, but I'm not so great under pressure.\n",
      "Oh, boy.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Uh�\n",
      "Uh, I'm sorry, I'm just trying to figure out how to start�\n",

      "Oh, no.\n",
      "No!\n",

      "Mmm.\n",
      "Mmm!\n",

      "Ooh!\n",
      "I love puzzles.\n",
      "They're so much fun, but they're also like homework.\n",
      "Win-win.\n",
      "So, what's my first clue?\n",
      "Ooh!\n",
      "Okay.\n",

      "Where are we going?\n",
      "This is, uh� kinda fun.\n",

      "Hi, whoever you are.\n",
      "Uh, don't mind us.\n",
      "We're just doing a trust thing.\n",
      "What was that sound?\n",
      "What?\n",
      "What?\n",

      "Oh!\n",
      "The puzzle continues.\n",
      "I did.\n",

      "Yeah!\n",

      "I'm not your friend.\n",

      "Eleanor, I� I have a soulmate.\n",
      "Look, I know she and I are in a rough patch, but we just have to find the answer for how to get out of it.\n",
      "Like my parents.\n",
      "You remember that story I told you about my parents?\n",
      "Well, but� living that way led me to philosophy.\n",
      "And, sure, I was written up in a medical journal as the youngest person ever with a stress-induced ulcer, but I got into the Good Place.\n",

      "You and I are on our way to Coolsville.\n",
      "Oh, well, when you have 1,000 different versions of yourself over multiple timelines fused and instantly placed into your consciousness, it gives you a real sense of clarity.\n",
      "Yep, saw the Time Knife.\n",
      "It was neat.\n",
      "Okay!\n",
      "Let's save humanity, shall we?\n",
      "Can one of you Janets get me a chalkboard and a copy of Judith Shklar's Ordinary Vices?\n",
      "Oh!\n",
      "And� and maybe some warm pretzels?\n",
      "If we goin' out, I'm goin' out with a belly full of warm pretzels.\n",
      "Yummy, yum-yum.\n",
      "Yummy!\n",
      "So, in this essay, \"Putting Cruelty First\", Judith Shklar contends that we should consider cruelty as society's primary flaw.\n",
      "Yeah!\n",
      "I got 'em from Disco Janet.\n",
      "Thanks, Disco Janet!\n",
      "Anyway, here's her point.\n",
      "Imagine someone sells a joint and then gets locked away in a dangerous prison for years.\n",
      "The crime isn't cruel, but the punishment is.\n",
      "That's a problem.\n",
      "This is the problem with the current system.\n",
      "Live anything less than the most exemplary life, and you are brutally tortured forever, with no recourse.\n",
      "The cruelty of the punishment does not match the cruelty of the life that one has lived.\n",
      "Now, watch this spin.\n",
      "Hearing you talk about philosophical concepts of justice is sexy.\n",
      "You wanna get out of here?\n",
      "It's definitely less cruel than the current system, but it's not great.\n",
      "Shut up.\n",
      "Shut up.\n",
      "Hi.\n",
      "Shut up.\n",
      "I'm confident now.\n",
      "The Bad Place will get emptied out, too.\n",
      "You will have no one to torture for billions of years.\n",
      "Everyone loses.\n",
      "What?\n",
      "That's very wrong, but in a roundabout way, you kinda got where you needed to be.\n",
      "Actually, what you just said, \"the very best versions of ourselves\", gave me an idea.\n",
      "Please have a seat, Your Honor.\n",
      "So, the problem with the afterlife is not only that it's� that it's cruel, but that it's final.\n",
      "You get one shot on Earth, and regardless of the context of your life, you're placed somewhere, usually the Bad Place, forever, with no chance for redemption.\n",
      "No, no, no.\n",
      "No, we don't.\n",
      "We barely started.\n",
      "Uh, so, when you die, you still have a� a points total, but in the new system, that number will serve as a sort of baseline to determine how hard or easy your test is.\n",
      "Yeah, and the architects explain what you did badly, what you did well, and then you get rebooted, and do it again, and again and again until you ace it.\n",
      "So, our guess is that with enough chances, people will eventually make enough good choices to qualify for the Good Place, and maybe some never will, but that's okay, because everyone gets a fair shot.\n",
      "Oh, don't look at me.\n",
      "I'm� I'm just the idea guy.\n",
      "So, these computers have access to every file for every human currently in the Bad Place.\n",
      "And the three of us have a very important job.\n",
      "No.\n",
      "Sure, but also, while Michael is trying to get the architects trained, we're supposed to find the first 1,000 humans to take the test.\n",
      "People who'll just sail right through it, so we can build confidence in the system.\n",
      "So, what are the criteria?\n",
      "Should it be people with the highest point totals, or overcame the greatest hardship?\n",
      "Jason --\n",
      "What --\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "The words are nice, but the tone is scary.\n",
      "Okay, if you don't want me to, then of course I won't, but nothing in there could ever change how I feel about you.\n",
      "What did you do on Halloween 2013?\n",
      "I don't need to read your file.\n",
      "I know you.\n",
      "And I love you, and I can't wait to spend eternity with you.\n",
      "I mean, obviously, we have a lot of work to do here, and then we both have to pass the test.\n",
      "But, eventually, we're gonna be together forever.\n",
      "What?\n",
      "I'm confused.\n",
      "Is this a game?\n",
      "Is it a sex game, somehow?\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "I'll read your file.\n",
      "Can I finish reading about Oskar Schindler first?\n",
      "After as many attempts as it takes, if your human passes the test and proves that they deserve to go to the Good Place, you'll hear this sound.\n",
      "No.\n",
      "I don't hate you at all.\n",
      "I mean, you were dealt a pretty tough hand.\n",
      "You essentially had to raise yourself, but you were still more confident and self-possessed at 13 than I ever was.\n",
      "I mean, seeing your whole life all laid out like this, it's� it's remarkable.\n",
      "I'm not good enough for you!\n",
      "I mean� look at my file.\n",
      "It is one-tenth as long as yours, because I did nothing with my life.\n",
      "I am confident about my feelings for you.\n",
      "I am also confident that I am a damn drip, and you deserve to be with someone who's not.\n",
      "Like Nicolas, that fireman that you dated back in 2009?\n",
      "He rescued people from burning buildings, and he was so hot!\n",
      "What --\n",
      "I moved!\n",
      "And it got buried in the bottom of a box.\n",
      "I put the library in my will to make up for it.\n",
      "I do?\n",
      "Looking at Eleanor's life made me realize how different we are.\n",
      "If the system works, and we both pass our tests, I don't see any version of eternity where she doesn't get bored of me.\n",
      "I mean, my fake heaven was a 600 square-foot apartment that was essentially a bookcase and a toilet� and I loved it.\n",
      "Well, you need that to be true because you're dating Janet.\n",
      "Ultimate opposites.\n",
      "No, that's not� I'm sorry.\n",
      "I didn't mean�\n",
      "No, Jason.\n",
      "Come back, I�\n",
      "I wish I were back in my toilet library.\n",
      "Hey� um� I'm sorry I said that before, man.\n",
      "How do you know that?\n",
      "All right, listen.\n",
      "Maybe on paper, you and Janet don't make total sense, but who cares?\n",
      "The relationship you have built together is wonderful.\n",
      "She knows you and loves you, and that's all that matters.\n",
      "Of course I do.\n",
      "Sorry?\n",
      "Against all odds, I know what you mean, and I� I gotta give it up.\n",
      "That was� that was good.\n",
      "Hey.\n",
      "So, uh, I was being stupid, and Jason gave me some really good advice.\n",
      "Look, who we were on Earth is a tiny part of who we are, and an even smaller part of who we are together.\n",
      "So, I'm sorry for freaking out.\n",
      "But also, someday, when we get to the Good Place, I'm gonna learn to play the guitar so you don't get bored of me.\n",
      "Are you coming, too?\n",
      "Whoa!\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "You look a little pale.\n",
      "Did you get sick from the hot air balloon?\n",
      "I bet if you throw up it'll just be butterflies or something.\n",
      "� by a baby deer.\n",
      "So, about this party�\n",
      "Is everyone in the Good Place invited?\n",
      "Like, is Aristotle going to be there?\n",
      "Socrates?\n",
      "Plato?\n",
      "Hypatia?\n",
      "Of Alexandria?\n",
      "Uh, yeah, I know her.\n",
      "Hypatia.\n",
      "I'm gonna ask her so many questions pertaining to grand ideas about the universe.\n",
      "Like� \"Why?\"\n",
      "Oh, oh, and also� \"How?\"\n",
      "Is Big Ben somehow your godfather?\n",
      "Weird.\n",
      "Do you mind if I go find Hypatia?\n",
      "I, I, I promise it's strictly platonic.\n",
      "Technically, Neoplatonic.\n",
      "Forget I made that joke and come with me.\n",
      "I'm so nervous to meet her.\n",
      "And I need someone cool there to change the subject if I say something dumb.\n",
      "Um, hi, are you� are you Hypatia of Alexandria?\n",
      "It's hangin' really well.\n",
      "Um, I,.. I gotta say, I was expecting you to be, still, you know� ancient Greek.\n",
      "It's really her!\n",
      "I can just tell, somehow.\n",
      "It's Hypatia of Alexandria.\n",
      "No, also, is it \"Hy-pay-sha\" or \"Hy-pat-ia\"?\n",
      "Or in the ancient Greek, \"Who-put-tia\"?\n",
      "There's a lot of fun debate about this.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Well, uh� Patty, uh, um, I'm a huge fan.\n",
      "I, I had a poster of you on my wall in high school.\n",
      "Actually, it was just a poster of Trinity from The Matrix.\n",
      "But that's how I imagined you would look.\n",
      "Because you're so cool.\n",
      "She's one of them!\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Getting milkshakes with Patty.\n",
      "Um, but can I ask you a couple of questions first?\n",
      "Uh, you were a follower of Plotinus, who claimed that contemplation of our ultimate reality --\n",
      "A philosopher?\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "We are?\n",
      "Sounds fun.\n",
      "But didn't you want to tell us how we're all screwed?\n",
      "But� no, because� no.\n",
      "Because� Patty, no!\n",
      "Math?\n",
      "Dude.\n",
      "Uh, okay.\n",
      "We need to tell someone before we're too zonked out to remember why we're here.\n",
      "We need to find the Committee.\n",
      "Damn it.\n",
      "You were doing that to torture us.\n",
      "Actual paradise can't use the same playbook as hell.\n",
      "So, we have an idea.\n",
      "We're going to set up a new kind of door, um, somewhere peaceful.\n",
      "So that when you feel happy, and satisfied and complete and you want to leave the Good Place for good, you can just walk through it and your time in the universe will end.\n",
      "I'm glad you'll be able to enjoy things again.\n",
      "Art, math, philosophy, like you used to.\n",
      "Well, we're lucky we ran into you.\n",
      "It saved us.\n",
      "Yeah, no, I got it.\n",
      "This is what we've been looking for since the day we met� time.\n",
      "I guess that's what the Good Place really is.\n",
      "It's not even a \"place\", really.\n",
      "It's just having enough time with the people you love.\n",
      "I'll miss you.\n",
      "So, ultimately, this all goes back to the line from Professor May's book, \"Mortality offers meaning to our lives and morality helps navigate that meaning.\"\n",
      "Uh, yes, Professor May, you're probably right about what you wrote.\n",
      "Okay, everyone.\n",
      "We'll see you all here next week.\n",
      "Professor Hieronymi will be teaching the trolley problem.\n",
      "Never not excited about frogs, that guy.\n",
      "Yes!\n",
      "Hey there, Doug.\n",
      "Having fun?\n",
      "It's probably good you chose your young body.\n",
      "What?\n",
      "Yes!\n",
      "Can I ask you something, buddy?\n",
      "How did you� know?\n",
      "It's lovely.\n",
      "But she's not gonna forget you, man.\n",
      "I mean, she� she literally can't.\n",
      "She remembers everything that ever happened.\n",
      "You finished everything on your list?\n",
      "It's kind of your only options.\n",
      "Oh!\n",
      "Congrats, babe.\n",
      "The Da Vinci Code.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "After a thousand lifetimes of reading the most difficult writings in the world, I've acquired a new passion: garbage books!\n",
      "Hey, do you think I would have been a good symbologist� if that were a real job?\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "Oh, for dessert, we have to get the tiramisu.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah, it's always fun to see them.\n",
      "Every time we do it, it's fun.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "They were joking about that last time we saw them.\n",
      "Remember?\n",
      "Shakespeare went through the door.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Everyone's talking about it.\n",
      "Mmm.\n",
      "Do you mind if we go home?\n",
      "I'm tired.\n",
      "Uh� I'm gonna get ready for bed.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Surprise trip?\n",
      "Now?\n",
      "Can I change out of my pajamas first?\n",
      "Okay, okay.\n",
      "Oh� oh, man, Eleanor.\n",
      "Athens.\n",
      "Man, this city, it takes my breath away every time.\n",
      "Well, I mean� that's the Acropolis.\n",
      "Oh, and this is the Pnyx.\n",
      "Thousands of Athenians would gather here and listen to people discuss their city and its laws from that stage right there.\n",
      "This is literally where democracy started.\n",
      "Socrates, Aristotle, Plato, Diogenes� they all gathered right here in the Agora.\n",
      "It was like the Avengers, but for super thinkers.\n",
      "Oh, come on, you brought me here.\n",
      "You knew what was gonna happen.\n",
      "Honestly, that's kinda how I picture him, too.\n",
      "Koulouri.\n",
      "Man, I lived on these when I was here.\n",
      "Oh, that� is accurate.\n",
      "That is an accurate picture of 20-year-old me.\n",
      "This was so special.\n",
      "Thank you.\n",
      "Should we head home?\n",
      "Oh, man.\n",
      "Oh, wow.\n",
      "Paris.\n",
      "My favorite city.\n",
      "And you even picked the ideal weather.\n",
      "Overcast and chilly.\n",
      "Perfect for staying inside and reading.\n",
      "I used to come to this cafe every day when I lived here.\n",
      "I tried to sit in a different seat each time, so I could eventually say that I definitely sat in the exact same place as Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, and Richard Wright, Brecht, James Baldwin�\n",
      "Eleanor, I know what you're doing.\n",
      "Let's take a walk.\n",
      "So, Eleanor, here it is.\n",
      "I love you� completely and utterly --\n",
      "But I have to go.\n",
      "I� I don't want to leave you.\n",
      "I'm just� ready to leave.\n",
      "I have the same feeling that the others described, a kind of quietude in my soul.\n",
      "I didn't just have it.\n",
      "I've had it a long time.\n",
      "Remember that day we were with our parents?\n",
      "My mom kissed you goodbye� and got lipstick on your cheek, and your mom rubbed it off.\n",
      "I don't know why that was it, but� that was it.\n",
      "And I didn't want to tell you, because� because�\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "I won't go.\n",
      "Yeah, I won't go.\n",
      "There's� there is still plenty to do.\n",
      "I'll stay.\n",
      "Whatever you want to do.\n",
      "Love it.\n",
      "I'm gonna walk around my old neighborhood.\n",
      "See where I used to live.\n",
      "Meet you at the restaurant?\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "Let's see what's on the menu.\n",
      "\"Literally anything you could possibly imagine.\"\n",
      "Hmm.\n",
      "What are you thinking?\n",
      "You wanna eat that sentence for dinner?\n",
      "Can we eat words?\n",
      "Cause I asked Janet about this and --\n",
      "Ah.\n",
      "Those guys were more focused on rules and regulations.\n",
      "For spiritual stuff, you gotta turn to the East.\n",
      "Picture a wave� in the ocean.\n",
      "You can see it, measure it, its height, the way the sunlight refracts when it passes through and it's there, and you can see it, and you know what it is, it's a wave.\n",
      "And then it crashes on the shore� and it's gone.\n",
      "But the water is still there.\n",
      "The wave was just a� a different way for the water to be, for a little while.\n",
      "That's one conception of death, for a Buddhist.\n",
      "The wave returns to the ocean� where it came from, and where it's supposed to be.\n",
      "Not bad.\n",
      "None of this is bad.\n",
